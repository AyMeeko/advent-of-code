# advent-of-code

This repo will aim to solve the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1) puzzles from 2020. I plan to use Ruby 3.0.2.

## Installation

I'll be managing my Ruby version with `rbenv`.

```
$ brew install rbenv
# ensure `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` is in ~/.zshrc
$ rbenv install 3.0.2
$ rbenv rehash
$ gem install bundler
```
